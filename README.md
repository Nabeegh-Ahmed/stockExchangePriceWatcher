# stockExchangePriceWatcher
A python script that get's the prices of the stocks and puts them in a text file

Recently I planned on following some stocks in my country's stock exchange. I settled on five stocks. Then I decided to keep track of their prices after every 15 or 30 mins. But opening the websites and writing the prices is not every efficient. So I wrote this script, Which after a specified time, crawls through the exchange website, get's the current time, and put's the data in a text file with the current time as the name of the file.
